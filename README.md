Hi!
My name is Olga, I'm a molecular biologist with huge interest to programm languages and big data analysis. 
In my school years I thought, that biology and math are to different branches of science: biology was extremely bright, live and exciting and math was dry and boring. But so fat they met together in my mind and now I treat math with respect and try fill in the blanks in our relationships.
